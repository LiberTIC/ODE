ODE - A web API and aggregator for human events
===============================================

ODE stands for Open Data Events.

It's a RESTful web API that allows clients to interact with two kinds of
resources: events and sources. Events are human events such as concerts,
conferences, exhibitions, etc.  Sources are URLs pointing to event data
streams.  To collect event data from sources, we provide a ``harvest`` script, which may be invoked as a cron job.

ODE is written in Python 2.7 using the `Pyramid web framework <http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about>`_ and `Cornice <http://cornice.readthedocs.org>`_, a REST framework for Pyramid.

Development install
-------------------

We provide a ``Makefile`` to help with setting up ODE on your machine. You
probably want to do this in a virtual environement.

Grab the source code::
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/makinacorpus/ODE.git
    
Install the app with its dependencies::

    $ make develop

Run the development server::

    $ make serve

Web API
-------

The ODE API is based on
`Collection+JSON <http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/>`_, a JSON-based
read/write hypermedia-type designed to support management and querying of simple collections.
Events can also be represented in `iCalendar <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ and CSV formats.
Note that we don't use the Collection+JSON format for error reports because it doesn't allow us to
specify a different error message for each field. Errors are therefore reported in 
`Cornice format <https://cornice.readthedocs.org/en/latest/validation.html?highlight=error#dealing-with-errors>`_.

Assuming you've setup your web server to serve this API at the root of your
domain name, your endpoints will be:

* /v1/events
* /v1/sources

Collection+JSON and ODE follow typical RESTful conventions:

* POST to add a new item, eg. ``POST /v1/events`` to add a new event
* PUT to update and existing item, eg. ``PUT /v1/sources/123`` to modify the source with id ``123``
* GET to get a list of items or a specific item, eg. ``GET /v1/sources`` to get a list of sources or ``GET /v1/events/123`` to get a representation of the event with id ``123``.
* The ``Accept`` request header to specify which format you want to retrieve, eg. ``Accept: text/calendar`` to get events in iCalendar format.
* The ``Content-Type`` request header to specify which format you provide, eg. ``Content-Type: text/csv`` to inform the server that you're sending comma-separated values.


To make POST and PUT requests, you must provide an HTTP header that will identify the event provider::

    X-ODE-Provider-Id: xyz123


Collection+JSON contains URLs pointing to individual resources. If you need
to customize how those URLs get generated, you may provide an HTTP header
specifiying the mount point of the API::

    X-ODE-API-Mount-Point: http://example.com/api

Collection requests accept query string parameters:

* ``limit``: maximum number of items
* ``offset``: index of the first item
* ``sort_by``: name of an attribute to sort the collection
* ``sort_direction``: either ``asc`` (ascending order) or ``desc`` (descending order). default to ``asc``.
* ``provider_id``: filter by provider id

For example, if you'd like to retrive events 20 to 30 sorted by start time in descending order, you'd use a URL such as::

    /v1/events?offset=20&limit=10&sort_by=start_time&sort_direction=desc

Not that this list of fields doesn't apply to the iCalendar format for which
the specification dictates which fields are available.


Source data fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sources have a single field, ``url``, which is the URL of the data stream.


Harvesting
----------

We provide a ``harvest`` script which collects data from sources and updates the
ODE database. It takes a Pyramid configuration file as its only argument::

    $ harvest development.ini
